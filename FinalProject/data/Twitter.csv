fe054d03-27fc-4bd6-bb1b-e48a15e39573,I'm always bombarded with political tweets and topics and interests that I don't want to see on Twitter. Twitter makes it impossible to view your interests without pushing far right politics and Trump tweets that I absolutely don't want to see while on Twitter. Twitter is supposed tbe fun but they're really making it dreadful with so many ads and tweets that have no relevance to me and my interests that I come I Twitter to enjoy. Also the new name X sucks.,1

The only ads I get are for scummy crypto garbage, and there are times where every other tweet is an ad. More and more, the only people still using this app are the ones trapped there by a business (like me) or the types of people who aren't allowed at family get togethers anymore. An absolute wasteland, and a shadow of its former self.",1

I stopped visiting it so much months ago because it always would crash or I would have issues signing in. I went back today to deactivate, and so I took a quick stroll before I did. It's clear that x is trying to force people into paying for x to get away from all the ads that show up! It's also clear that x has filled it with bots and is toying with the algorithms.",1

First Elon wanted purchase twitter , then wanted to back out, but the left forced him to buy, then once he purchased and made changes, they wanted him to loose it,now the are creating all sorts of faux allegations against Mr. Musk, and X, then targeted users. Through it all, it was a platform that stood its ground against the left bullies and fake news. KUDOS to X",5

a8b3b6e8-8fc1-4955-bd4b-da288adb6039,Not a great app. I've used Twitter since 2012 and I'm getting bored with it. I have installed and un-installed Twitter so many times before simply because I have no patience for Twitter anymore. I am leaving a one-star review of Twitter. I use Instagram and YouTube more then I use Twitter. I like Instagram more then Twitterverse. I have left you a one-star review because that's just how I feel towards it now. Elon Musk doesn't even call it Twitter anymore! Which I find extremely annoying!,1
