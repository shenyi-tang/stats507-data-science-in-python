Seems like such an intuitive thing that was somehow overlooked. I'm sure most of us have Netflix on our TVs, and we need a phone to access the games... I figured, before trying, that it would be a feature; it seemed like an easy thing to do, and would make a lot of sense since Netflix is mainly a TV app. Maybe someday?",5

I'm South African and for some reason enjoy the #Korean serieses that are translated to English Audio. Proberbly because its ""clean comedy and thrillers"". I unfortunately give a big thumbs down whenever a #Korean series or movie cannot be enjoyed in English Audio as well. When serieses or movies are kept ""x rated clean"" our family can enjoy together. But otherwise you guys still stay top of our watching list when it comes to streaming.",5

Which Netflix discourages as your profile is now on multiple devices across multiple locations. Netflix was the last streaming service I still subscribed to. No more.

190fa558-e961-466d-9f29-e0fcfe312c10,It's 2024 and my last comment was a 5 star review in 2018. Since then Netflix has gotten outrageous with their pricing. I refuse to pay them. Movies are decent but definitely not worth it. Even to cancel with them is difficult. They could have made this pricing reasonable so we all could afford it but greedy thugs in upper management need to fund their jets. We helped pay for that. No longer we..you are paying for that. Subscriptions is going out of control,1

We have it for the kids. @#$& Netflix.

This is so confusion especially when Netflix keeps changing the same movie covers with different versions of the same movie. This is the case regardless of the movie in your selection or not. 2. Why keep changing movie cover pictures? Who are they trying to trick into watching the same movie unknowingly ?? 3. Not able to categorise.,2

I love the fact that there's no interruptions with commercials. I haven't found another like that. There's one I do like and downloaded but eventually I had to delete it bcuz the commercial interruptions were crazy. When I sit for a movie I want to see just that. A movie! Without commercials. No matter how long the movie is. Thank you for Netflix!!!,5
