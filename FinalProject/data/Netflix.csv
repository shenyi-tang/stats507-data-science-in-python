190fa558-e961-466d-9f29-e0fcfe312c10,It's 2024 and my last comment was a 5 star review in 2018. Since then Netflix has gotten outrageous with their pricing. I refuse to pay them. Movies are decent but definitely not worth it. Even to cancel with them is difficult. They could have made this pricing reasonable so we all could afford it but greedy thugs in upper management need to fund their jets. We helped pay for that. No longer we..you are paying for that. Subscriptions is going out of control,1
