Spotify audio quality it's TERRIBLE even with the premium, for 4 years now we waited for the new subscription with the better quality (it's seems that will cost between 15-20‚Ç¨, where tidal offers that for 3‚Ç¨ for students and 9‚Ç¨ for individual, even apple music offer the same cheaper). The only think that sticks me here are the podcasts, but i will listen to them via the free version",1

While I miss the days when the free option wasn't extremely limited, the problem goes far beyond that. The interface is less functional and intutitive than ever.

Very easy to use and navigate the app my only complaint would be that some of the songs don't have the lyrics with them which I believe they are continuing to add so it isn't really a issue since I can just look them up while the song is playing. Overall I would recommend to use this app.,5

This is rather frustrating when your 20 or more episodes in and don't have the free hands to scroll to your episode.,3

3948b885-e1db-46bc-b124-7936c704202a,"I will say that I have been using spotify for years now. I will also say that if you don't want to spend money, this music app isn't for you. If you're using the free version, you have skip limits (mine is 6 skips pure day, which is annoying), you can't hand pick songs, you can't download songs, and you can not switch your playlists off shuffle. I loved when spotify took a break from all those things I mentioned because I LOVE to skip songs, and I liked that free version much better",4

0390b914-7bce-4dd0-86b0-dd1449ba0a6e,Spotify was my favourite app for music but after recent updates the app has restricted turning off shuffle playing only through premium. I don't have any problems in the advantages of paying the premium but non premium members should atleast have the right to enjoy basic features. I am disappointed very much and I'm sure this isn't just me.,4

One of my favorite features is the fact of you ever forget the name of a song, you can search up the lyrics and it automatically pops up! Every year, the app does something call ""a Spotify wrap"". Spotify wrapped happens at the end of the year, It helps show you what music genres you mainly listened to this year and all that fun stuff. Very beautiful app!",5

Poor people who play online games cannot afford to pay for no ads and are forced to watch the same ads over and over again. When those ads are long, most people don't even watch them.

The app almost never remembers where you are in a playlist between sessions, so if you pause for a while or switch bluetooth devices, it reshuffles the playlist or outright stops playing 80% of the time, sometimes without closing the app. I would not recommend spotify and only still use it to avoid remaking my song list of 4000+ songs in a new app.",1

Unparalleled sound quality. That's before getting into all the nifty features like collaborative playlists and blends. The best new feature they added in recent memory is showing you all the playlists you already added a given song too already when attempting to add another. And top notch public privacy.,5

f3c24e95-2cb3-4e07-802f-b123cc03c50b,I was recently added to a spotify premium family plan and was immediately disappointed to find out that only the plan manager can access audiobooks. What kind of bogus garbage is this. I certainly hope in the near future spotify updates their plans. We're not feeling the premium status at this moment. What a smack in the face. Do better spotify,1

You can't even listen to specific parts of the song now. Spotify developers are just hungry for money. Again, such a nice app! Edit: ok so they fixed some issues, but still, there's a damn limit on how many songs you can choose to play next!!! Plz fix this irritating feature! Originally, I gave it a 2 star rating, I am giving it 3 stars now.",3

Can't unlike songs that I liked in the past and do not like now. The price is not right anymore. Strongly considering discontinuing service. I own a Wi-Fi speaker that has connection to Spotify and Spotify will lower the volume automatically without my input. It will skip songs without my input. It will speed up song without my input. It is just a broken app. I inform Spotify ü§∑,1

I pay for premium so that I get to choose and this is really messing with my listening experience. Hope this bug gets fixed soon. Would probably rate 5 stars without the bug. Update. Issue has actually gotten worse. Now playing random things I don't listen to which messes with my recommendations. Very dissatisfied. Update. Fixed issue.,4

I have to switch from my Maps to the app which is dangerous. What you need is a small banner at the bottom with a BIG plus sign in a bright color so i only have to look away for a second to add.

I recently started my free 3-month trial for premium! I can play offline if I download a song, I can listen to all of my favorites and see the lyrics!! I would absolutely recomend Spotify to music and podcast lovers any day of the year.",4
