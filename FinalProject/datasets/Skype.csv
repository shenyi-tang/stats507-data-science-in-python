Then takes another 10 - 15 seconds to open a chat. Then takes another 10 - 15 seconds to open the keyboard. On top of visual glitches where the messages are cut off briefly after closing the keyboard. And certain words don't appear to fit properly causing the last letter to get moved to a second line. It's ridiculous that I get a better experience on my old S8 than on my S24.,1

The worst is using emoticons, it's a nightmare of lagging and waiting for things to load. I wish the issues stopped there, but they don't. I can only assume the developers don't actually use the Skype app on a daily basis. It's really awful guys.",1

Other apps - no problem with mic or anything 2. Going into the keypad to dial a number is an absolute PAIN. Each number typed triggers what looks like a synchronous call to update the suggested contact list. Having a contact list with some hundreds makes this process TERRIBLY PAINFUL. 3.

Edit: Calls don't show up half the time, both incoming and missed, meanwhile chat notifications persist even after reading new messages meaning that you have to go out of your way to clear the notification when it would originally just go away automatically. The app also takes a ridiculously long amount of time to open as well, and the call UI is still awful. Don't waste your time with this app. Find something else.",1

Same with sending and receiving photos. Sometimes it works reasonably, too regularly it crashes. To get to see the full conversation again, you have to come out of the conversation and go back in, the lag is not good, sometimes that doesn't work. The only good feature is the instant translation.",2

My only option was to dispute the charge on my credit card, which required them to cancel my card and send me a new one because it was a recurring charge. Be careful!",1

There is NO option to hide your status. So when i open skype then everyone can see im online and then there are problems with why i am not responding etc etc. Obviously Skype has no respect for their users in providing this vital option. I will not be using Skype for much longer and will move to another app/program. And it wont be a Microsoft product!,1

However, as of this writing, it is the worst performing app on my phone; very slow and laggy interface. It has also become unsafe with how many scammers & spammers are abusing the lack of protections & enforcement. Now, there are many competitors to Skype, which are likely safer, faster, and more secure. So. I have reduced my 5 star review to 3, because of the spam and fraud that Skype allows.",3
