Atleast other streaming services inform you in advance that this content wont be available after a particular date. I better stick with other services as atleast i can watch whole content there.,1

Issue is when you turn Netflix's brightness down it still remains at 100% but just sims the subtitles. It is very hard to watch in a dark room as it is way to bright.

190fa558-e961-466d-9f29-e0fcfe312c10,It's 2024 and my last comment was a 5 star review in 2018. Since then Netflix has gotten outrageous with their pricing. I refuse to pay them. Movies are decent but definitely not worth it. Even to cancel with them is difficult. They could have made this pricing reasonable so we all could afford it but greedy thugs in upper management need to fund their jets. We helped pay for that. No longer we..you are paying for that. Subscriptions is going out of control,1

This is a serious issue it should be solved quickly because we can't see subtitles no more and this is worst experience because for anime fans there are scenes in sky and white background the we can't read subtitles so we can't know what is happening.

I want to cast a video the same as every other video streaming platform and you can't why because you have an Ad restricted account. Okay so how much is it to be able to cast double. I'll use the TV can't it is already at the max number of devices with one of the devices being the TV go back to Phone Can't because you've reached the max number of devices. Sick of it!,1
