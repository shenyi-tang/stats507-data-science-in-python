There is a heavy amount of bots in every thread and because of the blue checkmarks getting priority.

fa5cb611-5eb0-400a-821a-35f89ad0b25e,Recent changes to comment sorting and the block button means that the top 20 to 500 replies on every post on my feed is nazi talking points and stale ai reposts of the same comments and I can't even block these people and get their garbage off the page.

They can still see your posts and you can now see theirs. This allows stalking behavior and exposure to content that people don't need to see. Blocking is essential. It keeps those who are underage from engaging in communities that are adult oriented. Blocking stops abusers from tracking their victims. And now that protection is gone.,1
