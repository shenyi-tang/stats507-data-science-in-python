LIKE WHY do I have to wait EXACTLY 6 to 7 seconds (YES I COUNTED BECAUSE I'M SO ANNOYED AT THIS BUG) for a damn song to play. Like every single song I click on mobile there's some dumb bug that makes me wait until the song plays. I have a Samsung A32 phone btw. Like is it just glitching out on android or what??? I can't be the only one man. I paid for this!!!!!!!!",1

Uninstalled/reinstalled 2x and still only music. Also keep getting emails in Spanish despite choosing default English for my account. Couldn't find any help in community support. Even reddit suggestions didn't work. Have to figure out how to get refunded for this mo and quit. Also sucks there's no music lyrics like Amazon music,1

7d2bc48f-21e2-4595-84cb-ab6610612997,Been subscribed for over 7 years and got prompted to rate the app the day I plan to cancel. Bad luck... - Destop and mobile apps were poorly designed at the start and changes have been SLOW. Ex. The playlist panel on the destop app remained fixed sorted chronologically until 2024. - You can see the songs coming up in your queue but not songs you've previously listened to. Pain if you shuffle a new playlist. Not enough characters. Get YouTube premium. The music app is good and no more YT ads.,2

93c90593-bb42-4b17-9870-e5b0cb74df2c,Spotify won't show me my Spotify wrapped because I listened to podcasts only and no music. Also it sends me so so so many emails and notifications trying to get me to buy Spotify premium and I'm getting very tired of it. (Update: yt music started to crash for me so I had to switch back to Spotify. I got Spotify premium and my experience has greatly improved. I got fable and folly+ and it supports Spotify and not YouTube music. Also I found were to change notification and email settings.),4

Widget often doesn't work. Half a year later: some minor bugs fixed. All other points stay. App sometimes crahes - I suspect bluetooth connectivity. Some time later: they removed widget completely! Some time later: very flakey behaviour even for downlaoded songs. Perpetually increase storage space. Probably doesn't delete old weekly songs.,1

Offline playlists are great Only grips : - for duo/ family accounts you have to enter your shared address EXACTLY (eg rd not road) as the original family - they don't post small pay artists fairly / proportionally for streams. - You can't seem exclude a search word from results - sometimes Spotify playlists/radio songs aren't in keeping with the suggested artists / genre,4

If a musician is not getting hundreds of millions of listeners every month, they don't even get living wage.

When streaming podcasts, I consistently have issues where the podcast gets stuck in a loop so the same 15 seconds or so are replayed over and over again. I have to close out of the app, clear the cache, restart my phone to get it to become unstuck. I also have been having issues when I have a playlist on shuffle - it shuffles through the same 5 songs when there are 1000 in the playlist.",3

Not all of us can afford a subscription to A MUSIC APP. I have put up with the ads and I understand it. But not even being able to play my Playlists is downright absurd. What is the point of even having one if it's going to play its own songs and not what I want!! Ridiculous. Going forward this app COULD NOT get any worse. Such a waste.,1

I just want to have two devices with two separate queues. Not play at the same time, just be able to hand off.",1

The songs always play in shuffle mode. And without premium you can't even view the lyrics of every song. And don't even get me started on the ads. There are ads after playing every 2 songs.

0c20c56e-e6fa-42f6-8312-689cc461a3f8,This app is good. The lyrics are mostly accurate and have translations which no other music app has. A few weeks ago I got an email that music videos are now available for me. For 1-2 days I could view videos but after that I couldn't. The video icon showed up but no option to watch videos. Later the icon also disappeared. I can watch on PC but not on Android or iOS. Also AI DJ option is not available in India. So for that I'm giving 3 stars.,3

There is toooo many ads in the app. 3.I can't play any particular time of a song. 4. I can't skip song more than 6. These points are not extraordinary these are normal. But you made this premium.

It's not really worth it to get Spotify unless you plan on getting premium, they just keep making more features premium only. Also the shuffle is absolutely horrible; I've seen so many people complain about it, and instead of fixing it they put in the smart shuffle which is also terrible. The smart shuffle doesn't even show me new music anymore, just old songs that I've already removed. Also it's slow.",3

If this app was for some other purpose, I would have understood but no Spotify insists that I can not choose song because 6 switches have already happened in an hour. So, Spotify will only play that song which they want to play. This is completely useless. Had it not been the closure of much better app Wynk, I wouldn't have played this joke.",1

I've used the app for years and never had this issue before, it's such a vibe killer. I'm seeing other people report this problem, but there's been a few updates and it's still happening.",2

2a4c5f9a-ebf7-49e2-93ca-58f1a749b336,I personally loved this app but recently it's trying to get us premium at all cost ...this time it's saying to get premium for even choosing songs..like can't we even choose which song to play next?!! I request to atleast let us have this choice and right of our own!!!,2
