I've already downloaded 10,000 songs and there is a whole lot more songs that I would love to download and I can't, that sucks.

Cause unlike Spotify YouTube allows you to loop a single song, listen to your playlist on shuffle or how it's arranged all for free. Sure both have ads but unlike Spotify where you can't skip it, on YouTube you can. Of course you can't multitask and have more than one application on with YouTube but that's fine personally (YouTube didn't sponsor me btw)",1

I have to switch from my Maps to the app which is dangerous. What you need is a small banner at the bottom with a BIG plus sign in a bright color so i only have to look away for a second to add. Fortunately i can already skip through my car. Fixing this would go a long way to making the app safer. Thank you,4

Bad luck... - Destop and mobile apps were poorly designed at the start and changes have been SLOW. Ex. The playlist panel on the destop app remained fixed sorted chronologically until 2024. - You can see the songs coming up in your queue but not songs you've previously listened to. Pain if you shuffle a new playlist. Not enough characters. Get YouTube premium. The music app is good and no more YT ads.,2

And at last it is a good in a sense that we must not waste our time in listening too much music and thus it put a bar on that through ads. Its incredible....,5

5fd559b7-122a-4b84-80f6-cf31735b3ca3,When playing the playlists or the songs I downloaded to my device. Spotify uses mobile data or wifi instead. Killing my bandwidth especially in scenarios where the internet is limited. I fixing this but there was no setting in the app to do it.,1

Not even in your playlist. To be honest, that's stupid. Ever since, I moved to YouTube music, which offers all of this for free. Spotify is hungry for money on the most basic things in a music app. I just wanted to enjoy listening, but I'm not going to pay just to do that peacefully.",1

But even with that being said it's great and has a vast library, just make sure that you get premium, or else you'll be disappointed",5

I got fable and folly+ and it supports Spotify and not YouTube music. Also I found were to change notification and email settings.),4

Widget often doesn't work. Half a year later: some minor bugs fixed. All other points stay. App sometimes crahes - I suspect bluetooth connectivity. Some time later: they removed widget completely! Some time later: very flakey behaviour even for downlaoded songs. Perpetually increase storage space. Probably doesn't delete old weekly songs.,1

0420f407-7a0b-4a5b-89e3-49520ccccf1e,This app is terrible don't use it. You can't play the songs you want unless you pay. Once the song ends it'll switch you over to some random song from who the heck knows where. Lots of ads. And it doesn't matter if you make a playlist it'll still switch you to random songs that aren't even on the playlist sometimes. Overall it's an infuriating and terrible experience.,1

Most recent i noticed that is absolutely infuriating is if I listen to dowloaded pods and press the ffwd control on the sterting wheel the app plays the next pod in the list instead of fastforwarding 15 seconds like it does when listening to the same pod ftom any other menu. Software enginerrs need to do better at testing the app in real world scenarios.,2

However if you don't do the same dont pay for it. I'm not impressed with how frequently the price has been going up. I paid 10 bucks for 4 years, then in about April this year it went up a dollar and within two months it went up again by another dollar. I still love how it runs and I've yet to find an issue w it. The AI dj is bad tho.",4

Offline playlists are great Only grips : - for duo/ family accounts you have to enter your shared address EXACTLY (eg rd not road) as the original family - they don't post small pay artists fairly / proportionally for streams. - You can't seem exclude a search word from results - sometimes Spotify playlists/radio songs aren't in keeping with the suggested artists / genre,4

If a musician is not getting hundreds of millions of listeners every month, they don't even get living wage. Basically that you chose a song you want to listen to, and there's like a 60% chance that Spotify just decides ""nope!

Only sometimes, it lets you watch lyrics and skip adds. There are way too many ads. You get around 4 adds every 2 songs. Then it says you get 30 minutes of interrupted listening, but then it gives you an add after 5 to 7 min. Sometimes,when you go to find a song,it gives you a completely different song.

Still problems to manage songs in large playlists. And swiping for add to queue is not working occasionally.,1

If you listen to podcasts you will be shown several ads both by creators and by the app itself. They do not care if you have premium. Secondly if you want to listen to audio books they limit the amount of time you can listen to them. It doesn't matter if you have premium. With premium I used to be able to listen longer to audio books and have less ads with my podcasts. Look forward to same copied message.,1

Once in awhile the algorithm gets certain things wrong but it's probably hard to keep up with somebody with ADHD my mood changes really quick or I get stuck on one particular type of music. The algorithm is the only reason that I gave you guys four instead of five. If it was slightly better you guys would have five,4

Gaana skip karna hai to premium kharido. Ads skip karna hai to premium kharido. Playlist me random song nahi sunne to premium kharido. Khudki playlist banake gaane sunne hai tab bhi premium kharido.

It would be significantly better for them to just have a specific subscription option that included audio books.",1

Not all of us can afford a subscription to A MUSIC APP. I have put up with the ads and I understand it. But not even being able to play my Playlists is downright absurd. What is the point of even having one if it's going to play its own songs and not what I want!! Ridiculous. Going forward this app COULD NOT get any worse. Such a waste.,1

So much easier to use. However their shuffle sucks it will play the same band 4 times in row or the other option of smart shuffle also sucks and tries to add songs you don't like by a band you don't like,2

Uno si evita di scaricare la musica per usufruirne solo online e poi si ritrova 10 GB di musica in cache.

I've turned off all ads yet I'm still getting recommendations. Every playlist comes back to the same songs that are already on my liked list. It's as if there are only 200 songs in the world,2

78a0fb1e-91f2-42a7-bfa8-abc8877f7868,Having put off updating since version 8.8.52.458 I (reviews put me off) but now took the plunge. Now shuffle keeps playing the same songs & tracks I've recently played keeps downloading even though I have this turned off as it keeps turning itself on - very annoying. Would like to see how much tracks is in a Playlist (like you do on Desktop) and would like to be able to sort Albums in library so an Artists' albums would show in chronological order rather than alphabetical.

I use my account on 2 devices and want to keep those separate as they are used for separate things. Spotify connect makes this close to impossible and only work arounds I've found are ""have a different account"" or ""download what you want to listen to"" Edit: The response I received is more of the same. I just want to have two devices with two separate queues. Not play at the same time, just be able to hand off.",1

For example if you've had a couple of months of soul, but fancy moving onto rock, it will make song radio more soul based rather than off the actual song you have chosen. I know the point is to make it personal but then we're stuck in a box. Also you can't search your playlists, there is an option but it won't find songs only artists you've saved.",3

The podcast with ads don't have additional ads but podcasts which never had ads on my PAID PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION now have wholly irrelevant ads.

cf04cdb1-f607-46c1-ba3c-d86eac887332,"Not worth the hype. Other apps are better. In Spotify, whats the point of having a playlist if the songs don't play in the order of the playlist . The songs always play in shuffle mode. And without premium you can't even view the lyrics of every song. And don't even get me started on the ads. There are ads after playing every 2 songs. Only people who have used this app before will realise that actually this isn't a great app at all because in comparison the other apps provide better features.",1

It is so incredibly glitchy, with the search bar taking forever to load and sometimes when searching music in your library it comes up with zero search results when it feels like it.

I personally left this app for a while and tbh I would really suggest y'all aswell to not use spotify. Instead, use spotify-x, search it up on Google, click on the 1st site, install the file and download that. It is the best alternative of spotify tm! Thank me later",1

A lot of the time it'll automatically start at the beginning of the playlist or switch to a completely different playlist when it connects to the cars bluetooth. On the upside the yearly reminders of which songs you hyperfixated on in the last 12 months is a fun little feature to remind you that you can't get past having that one song or band on repeat for the past 5 years,3

Keeping this at one star, though I am still using it. 😅 Tried logging out and reinstalling the app but still, it will play hidden songs from time to time. It's kind of annoying since it's nearly December and almost time for your top songs of the year. When it arrives, lo and behold, some hidden tracks will be there. I am not even surprised anymore but I am not even pissed at the same time. Just meh, it has and always been this way. LoL.",1

Also the shuffle is absolutely horrible; I've seen so many people complain about it, and instead of fixing it they put in the smart shuffle which is also terrible. The smart shuffle doesn't even show me new music anymore, just old songs that I've already removed. Also it's slow.",3

And of course, each new password can not be similar to any previous password... so ... if you use this service, get ready for constant interruptions and deep memory for all of the oasswords you will have to remember. Avoid this trash and go back to buying music outright. They barely pay musicians anyway, so that would be a better path.",1

From what I've learned this an issue that several are experiencing and Spotify is aware, yet does not appear willing to alleviate the problem.

52282159-bca8-4063-ad9c-3435c36ab8ff,The free version is almost unusable. Listening to an album in full is such a pain with their horrible shuffle options (sometimes the songs on shuffle are not even in the same language or genre or mood completely ruining the listening experience) and the limitation of songs that we can choose manually. The only reason I haven't uninstalled the app already is because I have saved songs for almost 6 years on it.,1

Nearly every second podcast episode starts with more than one ad in my country's main language even though I'm listening to stuff in English.

However regarding the recent update, Spotify Free users have been forced to use the ""*Smart Shuffle*"" feature in their playlists which adds random songs to your playlists as it plays. The problem here is that this 'feature' does not enable you to listen to ONLY the songs in your playlist which is slightly annoying. If the people at the office could fix this, it would be really helpful, Thanks!",3
