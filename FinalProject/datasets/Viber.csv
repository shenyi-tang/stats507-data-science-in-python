8538615a-1d3f-4654-8fb9-f3fb51a435a7,"Horrible. This app and media in it uses phone storage , it is like a pest taking up all phone memory and slowly taking it ower completely. Clearing catches does not work, there is no way on android to clear storage. Many functions do not work properly. Viber support is hopeless. They do not solve any issues and closed down the tickets",1
d15328d5-2118-416c-9906-5b28cf892272,"Comes up with annoying advertisement that regularly pops up unless you cough up money to remove the ads. This has become a mulcting endeavor. Glad Viber removed and fixed that ad. But, it also tells you many times a day that ""you have a group message"" but when you open the app there's none. Wish Viber can fix this, too! UPDATE 11/13/24 Now, I turned Viber's notification off and I regained my peace of mind back.",1

Because of this I am now being added into potentially nefarious group chats without my permission. AND, Viber made the setting to stop this hard to find. Do better Viber.

Also, removing the button to not receive business messages is the biggest disregard to user privacy. Also, why is viber opening shopee app when user only made a call? Malvertisement much?",1

So many garbage ""features"" that just make the user's experience bad, but one of their latest moronic updates finally made me rate it. When an unknown number messages you, the message is blurred and you initially have the option to report it as spam. For some idiotic reason, there's no option to first read the message to confirm it's spam and THEN report. Once you get rid of the option to report it, it's gone forever",1

5e47a64c-445e-4e12-aa57-8a790607b1e9,The worst messaging app on the market. You get notificiations for promotions which you cant easily opt out of. Ads on freeware is fine but getting NOTIFICATIONS for ads is another low. [Reply to the developers]: The ability to send a request is not a satisfactory solution to the problem. There is no guarantee my request is going to get approved and I shouldnt have received promotional messages IN A MESSAGING APP. If you decide to be that cheap at least make optiong out possible as an app setting,1

e1a6b31f-c4a7-4859-af62-875e1fe3a770,Since recent updates in the last few month the call list on the different devices is a big mess. People calling within a group the device where you pick it up fine but all other devices shows as a separate call from the caller (not within the group) and the time stamp on the call is the time when the device connects to the server. So maybe days later it shows that you have a missed call just now from somebody who called days before and you received the call. And all devices shows as missed call.,2

I just spent an hour talking between Hong Kong and Canada on my cell phone because you guys started including my cellphone line in the Viber app. I didn't notice that I was returning the call on my cellphone line and that's going to cost me a lot of money. I'm sure that I've previously turned off your unnecessary caller ID as well. If I open Viber, I want to use Viber. When my prepaid minutes are used up I'll find another service. This will cost me about $70 USD. I'm livid.",1

2456d8f6-b2b3-4764-93ee-d368c4df343c,I'm changing my review. Viber blocked my number for no reason. You should look into both sides of the case and give a chance for the other person to explain before you block somebody's number. That is very uncalled from Viber! Very unprofessional. I never experience any discrimination in my life.,1

The activation call is from a hidden Private number so you can't see the last 4 numbers which is the activation code .Then they send you an activation code via sms which is 6digits while the app asks 4 digits... I wonder which genius there on Viber thought this method of verifying and activating accounts by sending 6 digit activation codes to 4 digits requests... He should work on Space X or NASA.,1

Viber never gets better, after more than 10 years of using it, it only makes me hate it even more every use. Calls are of bad quality, messages are late and so are notifications. They only appear once when i enter the app, but i believe i don't have to explain why its useless. When sending photos, they mix. It became so laggy for no reason, and all these adds... I even had trouble deleting it! Guys, stick to wap or smth else.",1

To me this is unwanted spam, and dealing with it is waste of time and inconvenience. 2. Constant suggestions for people to follow, i can choose on my own whom to follow, i do not need someone to suggest me. 3. Constant nagging about stickers, i do not want so much bloat, and all these suggestions, are a distraction and i do like it. Sorry but im not interested in viber app anymore.",1

I'm using viber out, calling all countries without any problems. Didn't have issues so far.

Horrendous button placement I'd rather have one button which opens the picture and sticker options than all of the buttons just being in the middle of the screen with a misroscopic area for text input.",1

362ad343-785b-495c-8b3f-fb3e8a743cc0,"- Viber is one of the worst messaging/calling apps when it comes to call quality (audio & video). We compared it to 20 popular chat/call apps using the Pixel 8 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and S24 Ultra. - It sends and receives messages later than others, even on the same WiFi or 5G connection. - When sending multiple photos, it scatters them one by one rather than in a collage format (like Telegram, etc.). - The advertisements are obtrusive. - It needs a complete UI overhaul Viber, wake up!",1

Viber as well, should include.. again.. suggesting the internal screenlock for its app. Overall, love how they added ""Folders"" to manage chat. I think, they should add more folders to manage some of the chats. Thank you! Hope this will be considered.",3

01fcdfcd-22a6-4fa9-a724-8c67d610b670,Rakuten Viber Messenger is an internal competition between developers and corporate desires to be a payment solution. It seems that everybody working for the company lost at least half of their brain power somewhere along 2020-2024. Now the company has literal zombie army of developers and it really shows on the app itself.,1
